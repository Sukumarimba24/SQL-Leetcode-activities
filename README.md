**Summary**


The SQL_Leetcode_Challenges_and_Learnings.sql file contains solutions to multiple SQL problems from LeetCode, designed to strengthen database querying and analytical skills. The file covers fundamental to intermediate SQL concepts such as SELECT queries, filtering using WHERE conditions, sorting with ORDER BY, and grouping data using GROUP BY with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN. It also includes the use of HAVING clauses for grouped data filtering.

In addition, the file demonstrates practical use of JOIN operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables, along with subqueries to solve complex logical problems. Conditional statements using CASE expressions, handling NULL values, and working with date functions are also applied where required. Some problems focus on optimizing queries and improving performance.

Overall, this file reflects strong hands-on practice in writing efficient SQL queries, understanding relational database structure, solving real-world data problems, and preparing for technical interviews in data analytics and database-related roles.
